/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Moderator and Administrator Applications.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a role-based access control model where only authenticated administrators can read application data.
 * Anonymous users can create applications, but data access is restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /applications_moderator/{applicationId}: Stores moderator applications. Accessible only to administrators.
 * - /applications_administrator/{applicationId}: Stores administrator applications. Accessible only to administrators.
 * - /applications_programmer/{applicationId}: Stores programmer applications. Accessible only to administrators.
 * - /applications_designer/{applicationId}: Stores designer applications. Accessible only to administrators.
 * - /roles_administrator/{userId}: Stores administrator role assignments. Presence of a document indicates administrator status.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Anonymous users are allowed to CREATE applications.
 * - Only authenticated users with the 'administrator' role can read (GET, LIST) application data.
 * - No public listing of applications is permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `roles_administrator` collection is used to determine administrator status. This allows us to authorize `get` and `list` operations using the `exists()` function.
